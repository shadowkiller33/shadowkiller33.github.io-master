My name is Lingfeng Shen(沈凌峰), a graduate at Department of Computer Science, Johns Hopkins University.


Research Interest
=====
My research interests are in natural language processing (NLP), particularly in its intersections with machine learning (ML). These interests have drawn me toward two main research directions:

1. Assessing Robustness of NLP Models: High-performing models are still difficult to debug and fail catastrophically in the presence of changing data distributions and adversaries. How can we build robust NLP systems against such challenges?
2. Evaluation paradigm in NLG tasks: In various NLG tasks, new models and methods have been consistently proposed. Correspondingly, relatively few attention has been paid to the correctness and fairness of the evaluation metrics.
3. In-context learning (ICL) ability behind the LLMs: LLM has shown amazing ICL competence, which obtains substantial progress. Still, why ICL works and emerges remains an open problem. 

I am open to academic collaborations and please drop me an email (starkshen3333@gmail.com) if you are interested in collaborating with me.


Personal Information
=====
I'm an avid fan of the NBA and have a particular fondness for Chris Paul and Stephen Curry, who have taken over as my favorite players since Steve Nash's retirement. I used to be a die-hard supporter of the Houston Rockets, but my loyalty was shattered after their defeat to the Golden State Warriors in the Western Conference Finals in 2018, causing me to adopt a neutral stance. In addition to my love for basketball, I am also a dedicated fan of Hearthstone and World of Warcraft, and spend considerable amounts of my time immersed in various video games. I also enjoy engaging in discussions about the finer aspects of game design and aesthetics.
